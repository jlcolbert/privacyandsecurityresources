A curated repository of resources related to privacy and security, with a focus on local organizers and activists.

The systems set up to protect us failed them, were actively killing them, and so they took matters into their own hands.

I think it's important that we do the same for our privacy. The NSA is spying on us. It's time for us to learn how to safeguard against that.
